# Genetic Algorithm for Automated Test Case Generation

This repository contains the implementation of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for automated test case generation. The GA optimizes test cases for date validation, ensuring coverage of valid, invalid, and boundary cases, and is compared against random testing to evaluate efficiency.

---

## 🌐 Project Overview

**Objective**: Implement a Genetic Algorithm to generate optimized test cases for date validation, covering valid dates, invalid dates, and boundary conditions, and compare its performance with random testing.

---

## 🌟 Features

### Genetic Algorithm Implementation

🔹 **Chromosome Representation**: Each test case is a chromosome with three genes:

- Day: \[1, 31\] (may exceed for invalid cases)
- Month: \[1, 12\] (may exceed for invalid cases)
- Year: \[0, 9999\]

\
🔹 **Fitness Function**: Categorizes test cases into:

- **Valid Cases**: Leap years (e.g., 29/02/2024), 30-day months (e.g., 30/04/2024), 31-day months (e.g., 31/07/2024)
- **Invalid Cases**: Day &gt; 31 (e.g., 32/01/2024), Month &gt; 12 (e.g., 10/13/2024), Non-leap February 29 (e.g., 29/02/2023)
- **Boundary Cases**: Min/Max year (e.g., 01/01/0000, 31/12/9999), Day/Month transitions (e.g., 31/12/2024 → 01/01/2025)
- Rewards diversity to maximize coverage across categories.

\
🔹 **Mutation**: Applied with 15% probability to introduce diversity:

- Day: ±3
- Month: ±1
- Year: ±100

### Parameter Tuning

🔹 **Mutation Rate**: 15% chosen for optimal balance between diversity and convergence.\
🔹 **Population Size**: 100 individuals.\
🔹 **Generations**: 100 or until 95% coverage is achieved.\
🔹 **Impact Analysis**:

- Higher mutation rates increase diversity but may delay convergence.
- Lower rates speed up convergence but miss edge cases.

### Coverage Results

🔹 **Test Cases Generated**:

- Valid: 10
- Invalid: 10
- Boundary: 5

🔹 **Coverage**: GA achieves higher coverage (\~95%) compared to random testing, especially for edge cases.

### GA vs. Random Testing

- **GA Advantages**:
  - Consistently finds edge cases (e.g., leap years, invalid dates).
  - Converges to high coverage in \~30 generations.
- **Random Testing**:
  - Struggles with rare cases.
  - Generates redundant data, leading to inconsistent coverage.

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites

🔹 **Node.js**: v16.x or later\
🔹 **MongoDB**: Optional, for storing test case results (if implemented)\
🔹 **Dependencies**: Install via npm (listed in `package.json`)

### Setup

- **Clone the Repository**:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/username/ga-test-case-generation.git
  cd ga-test-case-generation
  ```

- **Install Dependencies**:

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

- **Run the Genetic Algorithm**:

  ```bash
  node src/ga.js
  ```

---

## 📖 Usage

- **Run the GA**: Execute `node src/ga.js` to generate test cases and evaluate coverage.
- **View Results**: Check the `data/` directory for generated test cases (valid, invalid, boundary).
- **Analyze Coverage**: Refer to `visualizations/` for graphs showing coverage improvement over generations.
- **Compare with Random Testing**: Modify `src/ga.js` to toggle between GA and random testing modes for comparison.
